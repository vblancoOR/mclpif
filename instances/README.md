The instances of this folder are real world instances from:
* **AP200**: Dataset from Ernst, A. T., and Krishnamoorthy, M. (1996). Efficient algorithms for the uncapacitated single allocation p-hub median problem. Location science, 4(3), 139–154.
* **324,500,708,818**: Coordinates and demands in São José dos Campos from Senne, E. L. F., Pereira, M. A., and Lorena, L. A. N. (2010). A decomposition heuristic for the maximal covering location problem. Advances in Operations Research, 2010.
* **ch2863**: Dataset with demands from Taillard, É. D. (2003). Heuristic methods for large centroid clustering problems. Journal of Heuristics, 9(1), 51–73.

We have normalized to the square [0,1]x[0,1] and put the real demands if they have. If the dataset do not have a demands, we fix them equal to one.
